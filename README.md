## DATA STRUCTURE

A data structure is a way of representing data in memory.
There are several categories of data structures, these include

    -Linear.
    -Non-linear.



### LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures whos arrangement of data is in  a linear manner, and that are sequentially accessed.
examples of these include,

    -Arrays.
    -Lists.
    -Queues.
    -Stack.


### NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures that do not arrange data in a linear manner, rather data is stored say in different locations in memory.
Examples include,

    -Trees.
    -Graphs.
