Data structures and algorithims using c

## DATA STRUCTURE

A data structure is a way of representing data in memory.
There are several categories of data structures, these include
<ul>
    1.Linear.
    2.Non-linear.
</ul>


### LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures whos arrangement of data is in  a linear manner, and that are sequentially accessed.
examples of these include,
<ul>
    1.Arrays.
    2.Lists.
    3.Queues.
    4.Stack.
</ul>

### NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures that do not arrange data in a linear manner, rather data is stored say in different locations in memory.
Examples include,
<ul>
    1.Trees.
    2.Graphs.
</ul>
