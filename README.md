Data structures and algorithims using c

## DATA STRUCTURE

Data structure defines the various ways in which data can be stored in memory and the various operations which can be performed on a data structure. 
There are several categories of data structures, these include
    * Linear.
    * Non-linear.



## LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures whos arrangement of data is in  a linear manner, and that are sequentially accessed.
examples of these include,

    - Arrays
    - Lists
    - Queues
    - Stack


### 1. ARRAYS

An array can be defined as  contigious blocks of homogenous data, the array can be of fixed size or a dynamic array, this depends on the implementation.


## NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures that do not arrange data in a linear manner, rather data is stored say in different locations in memory.
Examples include,

    * Trees.
    * Graphs.
