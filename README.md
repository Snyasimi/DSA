Data structures and algorithims using c

## DATA STRUCTURE

Data structure defines the various ways in which data can be stored in memory and the various operations which can be performed on a data structure. 
There are several categories of data structures, these include

    * Linear.
    * Non-linear.



## LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures whos arrangement of data is in  a linear manner, and that are sequentially accessed.
examples of these include,

    - Arrays
    - Lists
    - Queues
    - Stack


### 1. ARRAYS

An array can be defined as  contiguous blocks of memory containing homogeneous data.
Arrays can be accessed randomly thus their access time is constant, arrays have some draw backs which include

1. Cannot grow in size.
1. Deleteing at the front of an array is resource intensive.
1. 

#### IMPLEMENTATION



## NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures that do not arrange data in a linear manner, rather data is stored say in different locations in memory.
Examples include,

    * Trees.
    * Graphs.
