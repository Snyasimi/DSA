Data structures and algorithims using c

## DATA STRUCTURE

Data structure defines the various ways in which data can be stored in memory and the various operations which can be performed on a data structure. 
There are several categories of data structures, these include

* Linear.
* Non-linear.



## LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures whos arrangement of data is in  a linear manner, and that are sequentially accessed.
examples of these include,

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Lists
- Queues
- Stack


### 1. ARRAYS

An array can be defined as  contiguous blocks of memory containing homogeneous data.
Arrays shine when theres need to store multiple elements of similar nature.
Given an array of size *n* the first element will always be at *index 0* while the last element will be at *n-1*.

Arrays have some drawbacks, these are
 
1. Cannot grow in size.
1. Deleteing at the front of an array is resource intensive.

But there are also some advantages using arrays, these include

- Accessing any element in the array is done in constant time *o(1)*
- 

 

#### OPERATIONS

The basic Operations perfomed on arrays are

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Update
- Display
- Trasverse

Lets talk about these operations 

##### 1. INSERTION

The insertion operation means to add something to the array, we can add anywhere front,end or any given index.
Though remenber adding at the front or at an index close to the begining is resource intensive as all the elements after it need to be shifted to the left. 





## NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

These are data structures that do not arrange data in a linear manner, rather data is stored say in different locations in memory.
Examples include,

    * Trees.
    * Graphs.
